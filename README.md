## Hey 👋 I'm Joy! 
I'm a photographer, connoisseur, software engineer, and national athlete. 

Interested in network, infra, systems, and optimization. Love to sync with any interesting/exciting/latest techs.

I have several beloved repos hidden due to integrity reason but I do write C++ and Verilog a lot. 

I introduced this dashboard as a walkaround to encrypt my C++/Verilog contributions. However, this breakdown is far from being accurate. It does not record the time I spend on remote host/Latex/Jupyter Notebook. 

### This week's dev breakdown 🖥:
<!--START_SECTION:waka-->
```text
Python   25 mins         █████████████████████████   100.00 % 
```

### For Fun
Errors are red 

Screen is blue 

I think I deleted

"System 32"

### 共勉 
自古逢秋悲寂寥， 我言秋日胜春朝。

晴空一鹤排云上， 便引诗情到碧霄。
