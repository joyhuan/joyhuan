## Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Joy! 
I'm a photographer, connoisseur, software engineer, and national athlete. 

Interested in network, infra, systems, and optimization. Love to sync with any interesting/exciting/latest techs.

I have several beloved repos hidden due to integrity reason but I do write C++ and Verilog a lot recently. This dashboard is a walkaround to encrypt my C++/Verilog contributions :)

Notice that this breakdown is far from being accurate. It does not record the time that I code on remote host, which consists of 90% of the time that I code. I don't want to install WakaTime on remote host yet so just bear with it for now.
